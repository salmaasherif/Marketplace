# Marketplace
Our "Marketplace System" desktop application entails logging in and registering new clients, assigning them unique identifiers, storing their information in the system using MySQL Database, manipulating one’s cart and depositing cash into the accounts. The client can access the “Marketplace System” by entering their username and password. The system must identify the person attempting to log into the system by checking the entered credentials in the Database. If the entered credentials belong to a normal user, They will rapidly go to the Marketplace UI where they will find all the categories and items for sale. However, if the entered credentials belong to the Admin,, He will be redirected to an Overview of the whole system showing all information about the total number of active clients, the total profit of the system, and many other information regarding our Marketplace System. Any database modifications, such as add to cart, edit, remove, checkout and so on, are done rapidly and with synchronization. It ensures that client information is kept up to date.
